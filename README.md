# Project Rabbithole

Keep in mind that this project is still WORK IN PROGRESS!

A 60% ANSI layout alice style keyboard with a switch integrated rotary encoder support.

The case is made out of stacked acrylic and M.2 screws.

TODO: 
      
      -Adding an ISO version, 'cause we all love ISO layout :)
      
      -Adding a non Elite-C version of the PCB
      
      -Possibly adding a l2c OLED display support
